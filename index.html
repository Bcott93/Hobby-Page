            <p>Formula One (more commonly known as Formula 1 or F1) is the highest class of international racing for open-wheel single-seater formula racing cars sanctioned by the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA). The FIA Formula One World Championship has been one of the premier forms of racing around the world since its inaugural season in 1950. The word formula in the name refers to the set of rules to which all participants' cars must conform.[1] A Formula One season consists of a series of races, known as Grands Prix. Grands Prix take place in multiple countries and continents around the world on either purpose-built circuits or closed public roads.</p>

            <p>Formula One helped me get through the monotony of the first Covid lockdown. It gave me something to put my energy into, and ever since then, I've been hooked. It gives me something to follow, research and look forward to. We will see if that continues when my time is consumed by a coding bootcamp! </p>

            <p>I consume as much content as I can possibly get hold of! 
                This includes any freepractice sessions, reviews and podcasts after each race.
